# SimBank (Android üè¶)

SimBank is an **in-progress mobile-banking demo** built with **Kotlin, Jetpack Compose, and Firebase**.  
The goal is to showcase modern Android app architecture while recreating everyday fintech flows‚Äîsign-up/login, phone-OTP verification, balance dashboard, and deposit/withdrawal interactions.

## ‚ú® Features

- **On-boarding** ‚Äì Welcome screen, e-mail sign-up/login.  
- **Authentication** ‚Äì E-mail + password login/register, password-reset.
- **Home Dashboard** ‚Äì Real-time balance, latest transactions, and quick actions (Deposit / Pay).  
- **Transactions** ‚Äì Deposit & withdrawal with Firestore balance updates and error handling (insufficient funds, bad input).  
- **Account Page** ‚Äì Profile details pulled from Firestore and a one-tap logout.
- **Design System** ‚Äì Centralised colour palette, custom typography, reusable buttons & pop-ups.  
- **Architecture** ‚Äì MVVM, Repository pattern, Kotlin Coroutines/Flow, Hilt DI, Navigation-Compose.

## üîß How It Works

1. **Launch & On-board** ‚Äì Users land on *WelcomeScreen* and choose to register or log in.  
2. **Secure Auth** ‚Äì `FirebaseAuth` handles e-mail/password and phone-OTP verification (implementation not complete); ViewModels expose auth state via `StateFlow`.  
3. **Data Layer** ‚Äì `UserRepository` streams user & account documents from `Firebase Firestore`.  
4. **UI Update** ‚Äì Compose screens collect the state and render the latest balance, transactions, and any error pop-ups.  
5. **Transactions** ‚Äì `TransactionViewModel` validates inputs, writes a new transaction doc, and atomically updates the balance.  
6. **Result Feedback** ‚Äì A `TransactionResultPopup` displays success or failure with an animated check / cross.

## üèÖ Project Highlights

- **Modern Android Stack**  
  Built entirely with **Jetpack Compose** and **Hilt**, avoiding XML layouts and manual DI boilerplate.

- **Reactive Firestore Integration**  
  Replaces callback hell with **Kotlin Coroutines & Flow**, emitting live updates directly to the UI.

- **Composable Design System**  
  Custom `Color.kt`, `Type.kt`, and a unified `Theme.kt` deliver consistent styling across light/dark modes.

- **Learning by Building**  
  The project serves as a sandbox to experiment with architectural patterns, Compose animations, and Firebase best practices.
